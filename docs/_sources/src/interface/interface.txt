Cecilia Interface
======================

In Cecilia, all built-in modules come with a graphical interface, which is divided in different sections, common 
to all treatment and synthesis modules of the software: the transports panel, the In/Out and 
Post-Processing tabs, the Presets section, the grapher, toggles&popups and the sliders that control the 
parameters of the module. All these sections will be described in this chapter.

Transport panel
-----------------

The transport section contains a window that indicates the current time of the playback and 
two buttons: **Play/Stop** and **Record**.

.. image:: /images/Transport.png
   :align: center

 
- **Play/stop** button: Press to launch playback of the output sound file.  Click again to stop.
- **Record** button: Press to record the output sound to a sound file in realtime. You will hear the playback but priority is
  given to disk writing.  A "Save audio file as ..." dialog window will appear if the output file name is not already defined. 
  If multiple recordings with the same output file name are done, Cecilia will append "_xxx" to file names, where "xxx" is a 
  three digits incremented number.
  
By default, all sound files will be recorded in AIFF format (soundfile format and resolution can be changed in the preferences panel) 
and will be named by the name of the module (with the extension .aif).

Input - Output
----------------

The In/Out tab, which is situated below the transport panel, features different control options related to the 
input/output sound files.

Input
********

.. image:: /images/Input.png
   :align: center

This section is only provided with the treatment modules. To import an audio file from hard drive, click on the 
popup menu, below the label "Audio", and select your file from the standard dialog. Accepted file formats are 
WAV, AIFF, FLAC, OGG, SD2, AU or CAF. All audio files located in the same folder as the chosen file will be 
loaded in the popup menu. To open the popup menu and select another pre-loaded soundfile, click on the triangle 
at the right of the menu.

**Hint** : A right-click on the popup menu will open a window with the last opened sound files, for a quick access.

**Input modes**

The icon just at the right of the popup menu lets the user to switch the input mode of Cecilia. Four modes are available:

.. image:: /images/inputMode1.png
   :align: left

mode 1 : classic mode, load a soundfile in a sampler or a table.

.. image:: /images/inputMode2.png
   :align: left

mode 2 : uses the live input sound (eg. inputs from soundcard) to feed the module's processing (not available with 
modules using a table as input (ex. Granulator)).

.. image:: /images/inputMode3.png
   :align: left

mode 3 : uses the live input sound (eg. inputs from soundcard) to fill the sampler buffer (instead of loading a soundfile).

.. image:: /images/inputMode4.png
   :align: left

mode 4 : uses a double buffer to continuously fill the sampler with new samples from the live input sound (not available with 
modules using a table as input).

**Input tools**

In the Input section, the toolbox at the far right presents three icons that are shortcuts to some features of Cecilia:

.. image:: /images/Icones-In.png

Click on the *loudspeaker* to open the imported sound file with your favorite sound player. If no application has been selected 
in the Preferences yet, a dialog window will appear. 

Click on the *scissors* to edit the sound file in an editor application. If no application has been selected in the 
Preferences yet, a dialog window will appear.

Click on the *triangle* to open the sampler frame dialog window for more options on the source sound file.

**Sampler Controls**

.. image:: /images/SourceSoundControls.png
   :align: center

In this window, as in the main Input section, click on the *loudspeaker* to play the source sound file or on the *scissors* 
to edit the source sound file with an external application. Click on the icon *clock* to set the duration of the output 
sound to the source sound duration.

.. image:: /images/Icones-SSC.png

Controls over the sampler behaviour are:

- The "Audio Offset" slider sets the offset time into the source sound (start position in the source sound file).  In the 
  "Loop" menu, there are four options available: *Off* (no loop), *Forward* (forward loop), *Backward* (backward loop) and 
  *Back & Forth* (forward and backward loop in alternance).
- If the "Start from loop" box is checked, Cecilia will start reading the sound file from the loop point.  
- The "Xfade" widget controls the shape of the crossface between loops. Choices are: *Linear*, *Equal Power* and *Sine/Cosine*.
- The "Loop In" slider sets the start position of the loop in the source soundfile.
- The "Loop Time" slider sets the duration (in seconds) of the loop.
- The "Loop X" slider sets the duration of the crossfade between two loops (percentage of the total loop time).
- The "Gain" slider sets the intensity (in decibels) of the sound source.
- Move the "Transpo" slider to transpose (direct transposition) the looped sound.  The duration of the loop 
  is affected by the transposition, as while reading a tape at different speeds.

**Automations**

All settings can be controlled through automations. To record an automation, click on the red circle on the left side 
of the slider and press play (on the transport bar) to start the playback.  All slider variations will then be recorded 
and exposed in the grapher at the end of the playback.  Afterwards, you can modify the automation curve in the graphic (see the 
corresponding following section).  Then, click on the green triangle to enable automation while playing the sound file.

**Bindings**

As with module's sliders below the grapher, sampler sliders can be controlled with MIDI controller or OSC device. Start
the MIDI learn algorithm with a **Right-Click** on the slider label or open the OSC assignation window with a **Double-Click**
on the slider label. See *MIDI - OSC Control* for more details.

Output
**********

.. image:: /images/Output.png
   :align: center

This section contains all options for recording the audio file on hard drive. Click on the "File name" label to choose 
the name and repertory of the audio file to record. Then, two sliders allows you to choose the duration (in seconds) 
and the gain (in decibels) of the output file.  Choose the desired number of audio channels with the "Channels" popup 
menu. The "Peak" bar indicates the maximum intensity of the processed audio signal.

In the Output section, the toolbox at the far right presents three icons that are shortcuts to some features of Cecilia:

.. image:: /images/Icones-Out.png

In the Output section, as in the Input section, click on the *loudspeaker* to play the source sound file or on the *scissors* 
to edit the source sound file with an external application (see above). Click on the *arrows* to use the output sound file 
as the source sound.

Post-Processing
-----------------

The post-processing tab is situated below the transport panel, just beside the In/Out tab.

.. image:: /images/Post-processing.png
   :align: center

In this tab, you can add post-processing effects on the output audio file. It is possible to add up to 4 post-processing modules.  
Signal routing is from top to bottom (but the order can be changed with the little arrows in the top-right corner of each slot.  
Set audio parameters with the buttons on the left side.

Choose the post-processing module in the "Effects" menu. The "Type" menu allows you to alternate between active module and bypass 
or to make a choice between different options, depending of the module.

**Automations**

All "plugin" parameters can be controlled through automations. To record an automation, *Double-Click* on the the little dot 
of the knob (it will turn red) and press play (in the transport panel) to start the playback.  All knob variations will then be recorded 
and exposed in the grapher at the end of the playback, the dot will turn green.  Afterwards, you can modify the automation curve in the graphic (see the 
corresponding following section). Another *Double-Click* will turn off both automation recording and playback.
