Welcome to the Cecilia 5.4.1 documentation!

Cecilia is an audio signal processing environment. Cecilia lets you create
your own GUI (grapher, sliders, toggles, popup menus) using a simple syntax.
Cecilia comes with many original builtin modules for sound effects and synthesis.

Cecilia uses the pyo audio engine created for the Python programming language.
Pyo allows a powerful integration of the audio engine to the graphical interface.
Since it's a standard python module, there is no need to use an API to communicate
with the interface.
